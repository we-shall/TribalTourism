# TribalTourism
An app developed to promote tourism in Tribal areas by tribal people. Any tribe can use this to promote their locality, business venture in tribal areas/ village. Local homestays, tribal tours, cultural performances could be promoted. Unexplored Bastar (www.unexploredbastar.com), Slum Gods of Dharavi (www.slumgods.in), etc. are some examples.


**TECHNOLOGY USED**

* Android-Studio
* Firebase

For promoting tourism we developed three Android Application:

* [The Tourist APP](https://github.com/vishalsingh9423/TribalTourism/tree/master/VillageExpandedView)
* The Villagers' APP
* The Admins' APP

All three app shares a common **firebase database**. 

The **villagers upload information** about the village (Speciality, handicrafts, cusines, homestay offers).

While the **admin registers the villagers** who can upload information about their tribal village. The Villagers' app is made in a very basic manner. So that it can be handles by villagers who are less educated.

Then comes the **Tourist App** this **app displays data of all tribal villages and their speciality**. This app is same as yatra.com. But this is meant for tribal villages. **The tourist can rate village and can upload images of various specialities of the village.**
